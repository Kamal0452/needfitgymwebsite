<div class="about"><ol>The modern concept of the gym has its roots in ancient Greece, where "gymnasion" was a place for physical training and education.
However, it wasn't until the 19th century that gyms, as we know them today, emerged. German gymnastics pioneer Friedrich Jahn opened the first gymnasium in 1811, 
promoting fitness and military training. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gyms gained popularity in the United States, with figures like Eugene Sandow promoting bodybuilding.
The fitness boom of the 1970s and 1980s further solidified the gym's role in promoting health and wellness, evolving into a diverse industry with various workout trends and equipment.
